        "\n",
        "### What We Are Doing\n",
        "\n",
        "Hugging Face is like GitHub, but specifically for machine learning models instead of code. It hosts thousands of pre-trained models that researchers and companies share publicly. To download the base models we need (TigerLLM and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen) and to upload our final LekhAI model after training, we must authenticate with the Hugging Face platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Authentication Is Necessary\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Downloading Gated Models**: Some high-quality models on Hugging Face require us to accept their license terms before downloading. Authentication proves you have accepted these terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Uploading Model**: After training, we will push the final LekhAI weights to our Hugging Face repository. This requires write access, which is only granted to authenticated users.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Rate Limiting**: Anonymous downloads are rate-limited. Authenticated requests get higher priority and faster download speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How To Get Hugging Face Token - Future User\n",
        "\n",
        "If you do not already have a Hugging Face account and token, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Go to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) and create a free account.\n",
        "2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select \"Settings.\"\n",
        "3. In the left sidebar, click \"Access Tokens.\"\n",
        "4. Click \"Create new token\" and give it a name (for example, \"LekhAI Colab\").\n",
        "5. **Important**: Select \"Write\" as the token type. Read-only tokens cannot upload models.\n",
        "6. Copy the token. It will look something like `hf_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ123456`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Security Note\n",
        "\n",
        "Your token is like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control. In Google Colab, the `login()` function stores the token securely in your session and does not display it in the notebook output."

        "\n",
        "### What We Are Attempting\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, we are creating a configuration file that tells the `mergekit` tool exactly how to combine two different language models into one. One can think of it like a recipe: we are specifying which ingredients (models) to use, in what proportions, and what technique to apply.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Are We Attempting to Merge Two Models?\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of LekhAI is to generate high-quality Bangla advertisement scripts. No single existing model excels at both:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Bangla Language Fluency**: Understanding and generating grammatically correct, culturally appropriate Bangla text.\n",
        "2. **Logical Reasoning and Structure**: Following complex instructions, maintaining coherent multi-turn dialogues, and producing well-structured outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "By merging two specialized models, we aim to create a hybrid that inherits the strengths of both:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Model | Specialization | What It Contributes to LekhAI |\n",
        "|-------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n",
        "| **TigerLLM-7B-Base** | A Bangla-focused language model trained extensively on Bangla text corpora | Native Bangla vocabulary, grammar patterns, and cultural context |\n",
        "| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B** | A reasoning-optimized model distilled from larger models, known for following complex instructions | Structured output generation, logical flow, and instruction-following capability |\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Is SLERP Merging?\n",
        "\n",
        "SLERP stands for **Spherical Linear Interpolation**. It is a mathematical technique for blending two sets of weights (the parameters of the neural network) in a way that preserves the \"direction\" of each model's learned knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "An analogy that works is: Let us imagine we have two compasses, each pointing in a different direction. Simple averaging would just find the midpoint, which might not be meaningful. SLERP traces an arc between the two directions, creating a smooth blend that preserves the essential character of both.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, SLERP merging tends to produce more coherent outputs than simple weight averaging because it respects the geometric structure of the high-dimensional parameter space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Merge Configuration Explained\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we create a YAML file that specifies:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`slices`**: Which models to merge and which layers to include (we include all layers from both models).\n",
        "- **`merge_method`**: The algorithm to use (SLERP in our case).\n",
        "- **`base_model`**: The primary model whose architecture and tokenizer will be preserved.\n",
        "- **`parameters.t`**: The interpolation factor. A value of 0.5 means equal contribution from both models. Values closer to 0.0 favor the first model; values closer to 1.0 favor the second.\n",
        "- **`dtype`**: The numerical precision of the merged weights. We use float16 to reduce memory usage while maintaining quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Note on Model Sizes\n",
        "\n",
        "Both models are 7 billion parameters. After merging, the result will still be 7 billion parameters (we are blending weights, not concatenating them). This is crucial because it means the merged model will fit within the same memory constraints as the individual models."

        "### What We Are Doing\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, we run the actual merging process. The `mergekit` tool will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Download both base models** from Hugging Face (approximately 14 gigabytes each, totaling around 28 gigabytes of downloads).\n",
        "2. **Load the weights layer by layer** to avoid running out of memory.\n",
        "3. **Apply SLERP interpolation** to blend the parameters according to our configuration.\n",
        "4. **Save the merged model** to a local folder called `merged_lekhAI_base`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expected Duration\n",
        "\n",
        "This process typically takes **20 to 40 minutes** on Google Colab, depending on:\n",
        "- Network speed for downloading the models\n",
        "- Available CPU and RAM for the merge computation\n",
        "- Disk write speed for saving the merged weights\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Happens During the Merge (Technical Details)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Layer-by-Layer Processing**: MergeKit does not load both 7-billion-parameter models into memory simultaneously (that would require over 50 gigabytes of RAM). Instead, it processes one layer at a time, loading the corresponding weights from both models, blending them, and writing the result to disk before moving to the next layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tokenizer Handling**: Because we specified `TigerResearch/tigerbot-7b-base` as the `base_model` in our configuration, the merged model will use Tiger's tokenizer. This is important because Tiger's tokenizer has been trained on Bangla text and contains Bangla-specific vocabulary tokens that DeepSeek's tokenizer lacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Checkpoint Format**: The merged model will be saved in the Hugging Face Transformers format, meaning we can load it directly with libraries like `transformers` and `unsloth` without any additional conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Warnings for those using Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Do not interrupt this cell** while it is running. Interruption may leave partially written files that could cause errors later.\n",
        "- **Monitor Colab session**: Google Colab may disconnect if left idle too long. Keep the browser tab active.\n",
        "- **Disk space**: Ensure you have at least 30 gigabytes of free disk space in your Colab environment. You can check this by running `!df -h` in a separate cell. Conversely, you can hover the mouse pointer on the top right on the RAM and Disk tab below the 'Share' button.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What To Expect in the Output\n",
        "\n",
        "We will see progress messages indicating:\n",
        "- Which layers are being processed (for example, \"Processing layer 0/32\")\n",
        "- Download progress for each model\n",
        "- Estimated time remaining\n",
        "\n",
        "When complete, we will see a message confirming the merge was successful and the path to the merged model."

        "1. **Bangla characters are recognized**: The tokenizer should convert Bangla text into token IDs without replacing everything with \"unknown\" tokens.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Triples the Dataset**: We effectively move from 102 examples to 306 examples without collecting any new data.\n",
        "2. **Robustness**: The model learns that different ways of phrasing a request (industry, tone, product details) should still result in a professional script.\n",
        "3. **Generalization**: It prevents the model from \"overfitting\" (memorizing) just one specific prompt structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Process\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expansion**: We iterate through each row and create three distinct \"Conversation\" objects.\n",
        "2. **Chat Templating**: We wrap these in the DeepSeek/Qwen2 chat template.\n",
        "3. **Tokenization**: We convert the text into numerical IDs.\n",
        "4. **Length Analysis**: We check the \"token count\" to ensure our scripts fit within the model's memory limits (2,048 tokens).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concept: Input vs. Output (Labels)\n",
        "\n",
        "During this process, the `system_prompt` and `user_prompt` act as the \"Instructions\", and the `script` acts as the \"Ground Truth.\" The model is trained to minimize the difference between its guess and our agency-grade scripts."

        "\n",
        "### What We Are Doing\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, we load the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model into GPU memory using the Unsloth library. We use a technique called **4-bit quantization** to compress the model so it fits within the limited memory of Google Colab's free GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding Model Size and Memory\n",
        "\n",
        "| Precision | Bits per Parameter | 7B Model Size | Fits in 16GB VRAM? |\n",
        "|-----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n",
        "| Full Precision (FP32) | 32 bits | ~28 GB | No |\n",
        "| Half Precision (FP16) | 16 bits | ~14 GB | Barely |\n",
        "| 8-bit Quantization | 8 bits | ~7 GB | Yes |\n",
        "| **4-bit Quantization** | 4 bits | **~3.5 GB** | **Yes, with room to spare** |\n",
        "\n",
        "By using 4-bit quantization, we reduce the model's memory footprint from 28 GB to approximately 3.5 GB, leaving plenty of room for training operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Is Quantization?\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantization is the process of representing numbers with fewer bits. We can think of it like rounding:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Full precision**: 3.141592653589793 (very accurate, uses lots of memory)\n",
        "- **4-bit**: 3.14 (less accurate, but uses 8 times less memory)\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern quantization techniques are clever enough to preserve model quality despite the reduced precision. Research has shown that 4-bit quantized models perform nearly identically to full-precision models on most tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Unsloth?\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsloth is a specialized library that makes fine-tuning large language models accessible on consumer hardware. Key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
        "|---------|---------|\n",
        "| Memory Efficiency | Uses up to 70% less VRAM than standard implementations |\n",
        "| Speed | Training is 2-5 times faster due to optimized kernels |\n",
        "| Ease of Use | Simple API that wraps complex configurations |\n",
        "| Compatibility | Works with popular models including Qwen2 (which DeepSeek uses) |\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Happens During Loading\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Download**: Model weights are downloaded from Hugging Face (if not cached).\n",
        "2. **Quantization**: Weights are compressed to 4-bit format on-the-fly.\n",
        "3. **GPU Transfer**: The compressed model is loaded onto the GPU.\n",
        "4. **Verification**: We confirm the model is ready for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expected Output\n",
        "\n",
        "After this cell runs, we will see:\n",

However, the skeleton generator for the model seemed to be unable to provide an output (on multiple tries) for more than 5 minutes, stuck in an infinite loop even after penalizing repetition. Such wait time is not desirable to the client, which is why we are opting for one with a lesser wait time.
